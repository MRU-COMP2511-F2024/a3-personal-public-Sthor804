            <h3> Artifacrt 3: Resume/CV/Skills:</h3>
            <p>
My work experience in customer service roles, including positions like Food Service Attendant and Bike Instructor, has been invaluable in shaping my communication and teamwork abilities. In both positions, I developed a deep understanding of how to handle challenging situations with grace, especially in high-pressure environments. These skills have not only been essential for providing excellent customer service but also in developing a strong sense of responsibility and work ethic.
Through my involvement in extracurricular activities and sports, like being Awarded Athlete of the Year in 2021, I’ve learned to balance multiple priorities and manage my time effectively. These experiences taught me that perseverance, dedication, and teamwork are key to achieving success—both in and out of the workplace.
Looking forward, I plan to continue building my skills and broadening my experience, particularly as I transition into new academic challenges at Mount Royal University. I’m excited to apply the teamwork and communication skills I’ve gained in real-world settings to more specialized roles in my future career. Additionally, I plan to take advantage of opportunities in my program to deepen my technical knowledge and continue growing professionally.

        <h3> Artifact 4: Skills  </h4>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and tools. Here’s an overview of my technical skills:

            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>
                I’ve worked extensively with Java, especially in the context of object-oriented programming and creating console-based applications. I am comfortable with concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures. I’d say I have about 90% proficiency in Java, and I continuously challenge myself with more advanced projects to improve.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Python</h4>
            <p>
                I have a solid understanding of Python, and I’ve used it in a variety of projects, ranging from basic scripting to building simple web applications. My proficiency in Python is around 80%. It’s a language I plan to explore more deeply, especially for data science applications.
            </p>
            
            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
                JavaScript has been integral to my web development skills. I use it to add interactivity to websites, manipulate the DOM, and manage user input. I would rate myself at 75% proficiency in JavaScript, and I’m keen to deepen my knowledge, particularly in frameworks like React and Node.js.
            </p>
            
            <h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
            <p>
                I have a high level of proficiency in HTML and CSS, and I’ve used these technologies to build responsive websites. My understanding includes CSS Flexbox, Grid, and advanced layout techniques. I would rate myself 90% in HTML/CSS, and I look forward to refining my design skills.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
            <p>
                I have experience using Bootstrap to build responsive websites. It’s a framework I’ve used for quick prototyping and creating well-designed pages without starting from scratch. I’m comfortable with Bootstrap, and I’d estimate my proficiency at 70%.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Git</h4>
            <p>
                I’m proficient in using Git for version control, including creating branches, committing changes, and collaborating on projects. I use Git regularly for personal and group projects and would rate myself 80% proficient.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Soft Skills</h4>
            
            <h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p>
                One of my strengths is problem-solving. I love breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces and using logical thinking to find solutions. Whether it’s debugging code or troubleshooting an issue, I approach problems with a methodical mindset.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Teamwork</h4>
            <p>
                I thrive in team environments and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. Through various academic projects and work experiences, I’ve learned how to communicate effectively with my peers and contribute meaningfully to group tasks.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>
                Whether it’s explaining a technical concept to a peer or delivering a presentation, I value clear and concise communication. I’ve honed my ability to articulate complex ideas, both in writing and verbally, which has been valuable in both academic and work settings.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Adaptability</h4>
            <p>
                I’ve learned to adapt to new environments and unexpected challenges. In both my studies and work, I’ve faced situations that required me to think on my feet and adjust my approach. I thrive when challenged and can quickly adapt to new tools, techniques, or situations.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                These skills have been developed over time, through both academic study and hands-on experiences. Moving forward, I plan to continue strengthening these areas, particularly in JavaScript and Python, while also deepening my understanding of web accessibility principles and user experience (UX) design. Each of these skills will contribute to my growth as a developer and allow me to take on more advanced projects in the future.
