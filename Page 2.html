    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Samantha Thornton and I am from Sierra Leone but born and raised in Calgary Alberta. I am currently a second year student at Mount Royal University majoring in Computer information Systems. This ePortfolio is a reflection of my journey as a student, showcasing the skills, projects, and achievements I’ve worked on so far.
        My primary goal is to grow as a web developer and to apply my skills to create innovative and meaningful solutions. Through this platform, I aim to share my interests, achievements, academic projects, highlight the technical knowledge I’ve gained, and offer a glimpse into who I am as a person. Feel free to explore my projects, learn more about my interests, and connect with me through the contact page. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my ePortfolio!"

      <h3>About My Competitive Jump Rope Experience</h3>

    <p>
        I’ve been involved in **competitive jump rope** for **11 years**, and it has been one of the most exciting and rewarding parts of my life. This dynamic sport combines athleticism, rhythm, and creativity, pushing me to perform at my best both individually and as part of a team. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Through countless hours of practice, I’ve learned the importance of discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. Competing in tournaments has taught me to perform under pressure and to embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. I’ve also had the chance to connect with an amazing community of jumpers who inspire and motivate me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking ahead, I hope to continue competing and even share my passion with others by coaching or mentoring younger athletes. **Jump rope has truly shaped who I am**, both as an athlete and as a person.
    </p>
