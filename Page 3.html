            <h4> History</h4>
            <p> 
            I have a variety of interests that help me stay creative, relaxed, and connected with myself and centers me. One of my favorite hobbies is crochet, which I’ve been practicing for about 7 years. It all started in grade 8 when my friends had already started crocheting, and they challenged me to make a granny square, a basic crocheting piece, in one day. Naturally, I couldn’t resist the challenge! That first experience pushed me to step outside my comfort zone. I spent hours watching a YouTube tutorial on repeat, and the satisfaction of completing that granny square was incredibly rewarding. It sparked a passion in me, and soon, I started crocheting regularly, exploring new patterns, and expanding my skills. As I improved, I wanted to share the joy of crochet with others. So, I took the initiative to create a crochet club at my school, inviting other girls to join and learn the craft. It was amazing to see how something that started as a personal challenge turned into a way to bring people together and create a supportive community. Crocheting has taught me the value of patience, creativity, and determination.

        It’s a hobby that I continue to enjoy, and I’m always excited to try new projects, whether they’re for myself or to share with others. Crocheting allows me to unwind and channel my creativity into something tangible, whether it’s making cozy blankets, scarves, or fun accessories. It’s a perfect balance to the technical work I do in my academic and professional life. My interests, especially crochet, have taught me the value of patience and attention to detail. Each project requires focus and persistence, qualities that I apply to my academic and professional pursuits as well. Whether it’s following a pattern or experimenting with new designs, crochet reminds me that progress comes step by step, and the end result is always worth the effort. Looking ahead, I hope to continue developing my crochet skills and expand my creative horizons by tackling more complex projects. I’d also love to continue crocheting while I start my future career to keep a balanced life as it is a  form of artistic expression. Even though I don’t do it as much as I did previously, it's still something that I enjoy and think I will continue to do for long times to come.
